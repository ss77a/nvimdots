# things to do

## well organised might be less so since my addtions

my alterations are probably lacking all manner of this or that
trouble is not knowing where to start looking,
how to start locating such issues and tracking them down

## more unicorn uninification idealogeologized notions

cargo and fzf and such are awesome next gen patches for systems find more
find those that arent neovim intergrated persee but workflow synigized all the same

## map and command

can these displays be colourized they are horrid. would like color to track, highlight etc

can these be exported to file that itself is styled ie export script make it into html
webtools browsersync toggle open could be learnt from to open a window that show
nveom config and colourizes it and could do it live could display checkhealth output also
(markdownpreview toggle works more like what I think since it has actual toggle commands)

## ensure installed - so when things break again it comes back in good and clear

ensure installed mason and tree sitter
astro-language-server, tsx

tree sitter comments, php

## dap

make this thing work well and go fourth for me and use the vscode thingy

## tree sitter

markid is nice but is it conflicting with legendary

## formating

null-ls-embedded

## testing

wow oh my wow - testing for anything and very nice interace

need to find way to make that package.json plugin plug into the system

## telescope

fzf - aint even working entirely or perhaps even at all (tbh scope of telescope itself baffles me more than somewhat)
media files
project - certain files exist in tandem or conjuction with optional additions makes directory a project
find way to auto indentify these folders and index them so they are used in fzf and then also in neovim
package.json access in telescope would be awesome (nui provides another way to overlay interfaces - wish telescope was an option)

## themes

some are just plain horrid. I want those gone and never ever seen again
only just selected themes - how?

## exiting

want some quick keys to both exit and save and exit
