# Introduction v0.0.1

Idea is that all regular development cycle tools will work within nvim and can
manage projects and helpout in a range of creative and useful means.
Expident you might say!!

This project is the work of ayamir, any issues or errors are added by me.
Using this editor setup may cause istances of major annoyance and/or delay
(maybe even crash your system) you may hate or love my changes. its a work in process.

At time of writing everything is working so smooth its a sheer joy and much
faster than vscode.

This is my neovim's configuration, which contains two branches.

I use [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) to manage plugins.

| Branch |    Completion Solution     |
| :----: | :------------------------: |
|  main  | config for nvim 0.8 stable |
|  0.7   | config for nvim 0.7 stable |

Chinese introduction is [here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/382092667).

**Pros**:

- Fast. Less than **30ms** to start (Depends on SSD and CPU, tested on Zephyrus G14 2022 version).
- Simple. Run out of the box.
- Modern. Pure lua to config.
- Modular. Easy to customize.
- Powerful. Full functionality to code.
